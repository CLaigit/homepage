  I am a current graduate student in UC San Diego. <p>

  I was addicted to the beauty of maths and won the first prize in National Olymiad Mathematics. Then I was attracted by the fancy of physics and turned to physics in Zhejiang University. To get involved in the forefront of physics, I worked as a full-time student research in UC Berkely in Professor Holger Muellerâ€™s group. Data issues have always been a problem in my research, which is what led me to become intrigued by computer science.<p>

  Now, I am in Computational Science, Mathematics and Engineering Program in UC San Diego.

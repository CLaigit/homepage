   <p>

  I am a graduate student at UC San Diego in Computational Science. Currently I am looking for full-time postion in Software Engineering or Data Science. <p>

  My graduate studies have focused on efficient scientific computation. My favorite areas of study are algorithm design, parallel computing, machine learning, database theory and data mining. I have also deepened my skills in computational mathematics via courses in numerical methods for problems such as linear algebra, ordinary, and partial differential equations. I have even sought opportunities to study how to harness the power of supercomputers and GPUs to produce powerful simulations of collision of galaxies and Ising Model in three-dimension space, some of the most difficult physics problems in gravitation and quantum mechanics.<p>

  <!-- Now, I am in Computational Science, Mathematics and Engineering Program in UC San Diego. It is an unparalleled platform from which I can pursue my dream career. I am enthusiastic with big data, which is a promise and a challenge in both industry and academia. . My dream is to become a superlative engineer to make a better world. -->

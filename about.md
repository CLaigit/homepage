I am a graduate student at UC San Diego in Computational Science. Currently I am looking for full-time postion in Software Engineering or Data Science.

My graduate study have focused on efficient scientific computation. My favorite areas of study are algorithm design, parallel computing, machine learning, database theory and data mining. I have also deepened my skills in computational mathematics via courses in numerical methods for problems such as linear algebra, ordinary, and partial differential equations. I have even sought opportunities to study how to harness the power of supercomputers and GPUs to produce powerful simulations of collision of galaxies and Ising Model in three-dimension space, some of the most difficult physics problems in gravitation and quantum mechanics.

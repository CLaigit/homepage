Participated in research on atom interferometry in Professor Holger Mueller’s group at UC Berkeley. Mostly involved in Raman beam preparation, laser control system, time sequence system program, circuit design and system maintenance. Successfully realized a microwave transition and aligned the Raman beam in preparation for interferometry with cold lithium. Trying Doppler insensitive Raman transition now. Will try Doppler sensitive Raman transition and interferometry next.

Participated in research on atom interferometry in Professor Holger Muellerâ€™s group at UC Berkeley. Mostly involved in Raman beam preparation, laser control system, time sequence system program, circuit design and system maintenance. Successfully realized a microwave transition and aligned the Raman beam in preparation for interferometry with cold lithium. Trying Doppler insensitive Raman transition now. Will try Doppler sensitive Raman transition and interferometry next.

Accomplished unsupervised machine learning algorithms to parse eeg data to spectrum and classify different sleep stages. It optimized the accuracy by 31%. It can also be applied to detect microarousal during sleep on single channel electroencephalogram recordings, which is a powerful to analyze sleep quality.
